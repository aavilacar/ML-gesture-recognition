The main ML code was written using Python on a Jupyter Notebook. Can be accessed here:

The template from which the main ML code was built was the 'train_hello_world_model.ipynb' example in the 'tensorflow/tflite-micro' Github repository. Can be accessed here:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world/train/train_hello_world_model.ipynb
If that link doesn't work try here:

The first few chapters of the 'TinyML' book by Pete Warden & Daniel Situnayake explain step by step how the 'train_hello_world_model.ipynb' code was built to create a ML model. The rest of the book shows additional ML examples of real-life applications and further ML practice.
