The template from which the Arduino code was built was the 'hello_world' example in the 'Arduino_TensorFlowLite' library in Arduino. Should be available by first installing the 'Arduino_TensorFlowLite' library in the Arduino app, and then selecting 'File --> Examples --> Examples for any board --> Arduino_TensorFlowLite --> hello_world'.


Chapters 5-6 of the 'TinyML' book by Pete Warden & Daniel Situnayake explain step by step how the 'hello_world' code was built to implement the ML model created in 'train_hello_world_model.ipynb' to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE board.
